You will be able to use that link on your personal website or social media network accounts. For Linkedin, we will actually provide an option in your notification email that will automatically create a new entry in your resume’s Certification section. 

How long is the certification valid?
------------------------------------
There is no expiration date. It is up to each individual to define when they should update their certification. We plan to maintain exam questions on an annual basis.
